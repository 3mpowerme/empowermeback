## GET /api/today-focus/

### Description
- Handler: `TodayFocusController.getAll`
- Observed behavior: route delegates logic to controller/service/model layers.

### Authentication
- Public

### Required Headers
- `Content-Type: application/json` (for JSON payload endpoints).
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when authentication is required.

### Path Params
- None.

### Query Params

### Request Body
- Controller-defined payload (see controller + schema if present).

### Validations
- No route-level Joi middleware detected in this route definition.

### Business Rules (Observed behavior)
- JWT decoding and user context are handled by `authMiddleware` for protected routes.

```

### HTTP Status Codes (Observed)
- `200` / `201` success (controller-dependent).
